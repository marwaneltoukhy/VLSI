# Final Project

This is the Very large-scale integration (VLSI) course, that I took in Virginia Tech. The final project was to Build a matrix multiplier using the systolic array architecture. 

We got the fastest and smallest layout in our section. 

You can find the project handout along with our final project report and the project itself.
